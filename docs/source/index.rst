poskiorb - Post natal kick orbits
=================================

Orbital parameters after an asymmetric kick on a binary during a core-collapse event.

This module computes the probability of finding the binary with a given set of orbital
configurations (period/separation and eccentricity) in a rectangular grid. Useful when exploring a
large grid of detailed stellar models.

For an application of this package to an actual system, see Simaz Bunzel, A. et al. (in prep)
